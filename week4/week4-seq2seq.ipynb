        "\n",
        "Using sequence-to-sequence modeling you are going to build a calculator for evaluating arithmetic expressions, by taking an equation as an input to the neural network and producing an answer as it's output.\n",

        "The resulting solution for this problem will be based on state-of-the-art approaches for sequence-to-sequence learning and you should be able to easily adapt it to solve other tasks. However, if you want to train your own machine translation system or intellectual chat bot, it would be useful to have access to compute resources like GPU, and be patient, because training of such systems is usually time consuming. \n",

In the simple seq2seq arcitecture, the input sequence is provided to the decoder only as the final state of the encoder. Obviously, it is a bottleneck and [Attention techniques](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq#background_on_the_attention_mechanism) can help to overcome it. So far, we do not need them to make our calculator work, but this would be a necessary ingredient for more advanced tasks. \n",

However, during the prediction stage (which is called *inference* in this architecture), the decoder can only use its own generated output from the previous step to feed it in at the next step. Because of this difference (*training* vs *inference*), we will create two distinct instances, which will serve for the described scenarios.\n",
